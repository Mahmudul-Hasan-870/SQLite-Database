## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Android Studio installed
- Basic understanding of Android development and Java
- Emulator or Android device for testing

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/android-sqlite-database.git


## Features

### 1. SQLite Database Setup
- The project includes a well-organized `DatabaseHelper` class that demonstrates the proper setup of an SQLite database using `SQLiteOpenHelper`.
- Clear separation of concerns for database creation, schema definition, and version management.

### 2. CRUD Operations
- The `CRUDOperations` class provides examples and utility methods for performing CRUD operations on the SQLite database.
- Demonstrates how to insert, update, delete, and query records using `SQLiteDatabase` methods.

### 3. Content Providers
- Implementation of a content provider (`MyContentProvider` class) for secure and standardized access to data across applications.
- The `AndroidManifest.xml` is properly configured to declare the content provider.

## Usage

### 1. Database Setup
1. Open the `DatabaseHelper` class and customize the database name, version, and schema according to your application requirements.
2. Implement necessary changes in the `onCreate` and `onUpgrade` methods for initializing and updating the database.

### 2. CRUD Operations
1. Explore the `CRUDOperations` class to understand how to use the utility methods for CRUD operations.
2. Integrate these methods into your application logic for interacting with the SQLite database.

### 3. Content Providers
1. Check the `MyContentProvider` class for the implementation of a content provider.
2. Update the `AndroidManifest.xml` file to include the necessary permissions and declare the content provider.

### 4. Testing
1. Build and run the project on an Android emulator or a physical device.
2. Use the provided examples in the `CRUDOperations` class to test the database operations.
3. Verify the functionality of the content provider by testing data access across different applications.
